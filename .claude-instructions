# Claude Code Instructions for Circular Economy Project

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üö´ NEVER MODIFY OR DELETE:
1. **Produktstruktur (Product Structure)** components and functionality
2. **Prozessstruktur (Process Structure)** components and functionality
3. **JointJS-based graph editors**
4. **Factory Configurator core components**

### üìã BEFORE ANY CHANGES:
1. Read `CRITICAL_COMPONENTS.md` first
2. Verify changes don't affect protected components
3. If unsure, ask user for explicit permission
4. Test existing functionality after changes

### üõ°Ô∏è PROTECTED FILES (DO NOT MODIFY):
- `components/jointjs-product-view.tsx`
- `components/produkt-management.tsx` 
- `lib/process-graph-generator.ts`
- `components/order-process-graph-viewer.tsx`
- All factory-configurator core files
- Database schema fields: `graphData`, `processGraphData*`, `processSequences`

### ‚úÖ SAFE ZONES FOR MODIFICATIONS:
- Advanced simulation components (separate from main factory config)
- New database tables/fields (don't modify existing schema)
- API endpoints (as long as existing ones remain functional)
- New components that don't interfere with existing ones

This project contains critical product and process structure management functionality that the user depends on. Any accidental modification or deletion of these components will cause significant disruption to their workflow.
